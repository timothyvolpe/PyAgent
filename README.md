## Installation

### Browser Headers

In order to properly mimic a browser, we need a set of headers to use that match what the websites are expecting.

Create a file `PyAgent/browsers.py` and add user agents in the format below (you can use a website such as https://httpbin.org/headers to get the headers):

```
header_list = [
    {
        "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8",
        "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
        "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5",
        "Host": "httpbin.org",
        "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1",
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:84.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/84.0",
    },
]
```

Its good to have a referral URL in there as well.
